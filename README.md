### brainf*** optimizing compiler

This repository contains source code for a native brainf*** compiler pipeline.
The compiler translates brainf*** source into a low-level C intermediate
representation before compiling the C source into a binary for the host machine.

The compiler requires `gcc` to be installed on the host system.
